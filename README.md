# insurance-ml-feature-engineering
This is a machine learning feature engineering project for insurance data. In this repository, I preprocess and transform raw insurance data to create valuable features that help machine learning models make better predictions. The project includes:

   * Data cleaning and missing value handling

   * Encoding categorical features and scaling numeric features

   * Generating new engineered features that improve model performance

   * Preparing the dataset for training ML models

Feature engineering is a crucial step in insurance ML projects because it improves model accuracy by highlighting the most important signals from the data.
